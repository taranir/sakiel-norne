Underlying Plot that was not explained or mentioned in the game:

	The boy is stuck in a world where no time flows. This world is called Arem. Arem is ruled by religious tyrants who believe that they themselves are 
perfect-beings chosen by God to rule the rest of the nation. When one dies, he comes back to life randomly at a different age and a different place usually 
with his previous memories. The main character awakens in Lucerne Fields with complete loss of memory and a great destiny before him. His mission: to dethrone the tyrants and continue the flow of time even it may cost him his life. Although he may not know it, he is destined for greatness. After defeating the elementals in Lucerne Field (you may choose not to), he wanders and finds himself in the town of Bareon, Where he meets a few citizens. (The game does not progress beyond this point)

P.S.: Contemplation on life and a philosophical criticism of the game, courtesy of Zack Li. What are solid obstacles? 
(Please don't grade us on this. We didn't write it.)

"People can be selfish douches, but they can also be a powerful force for good. To quote Margaret Mead, ¡°Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.¡± Does one wake up in the morning and watch Japanese cartoons all day, or does one enable others to live happier and healthier lives through works of service?
	
This question is easy to answer, but the question then becomes: why is the less positive choice chosen so frequently? This is a harder question to respond to. It depends greatly on the ethical foundations of society, people¡¯s personal sense of ethics, and a host of other factors. Occasionally, it may even involve economic thinking and reason.
	
The main character in this game does not seek answers for these questions. Rather, he seeks truth and meaning, in a world where both are scarce. The world is empty, and yet full. When one inserts oneself into the game via the container of the protagonist, and by doing so, is able to experience this richness of the void that is Sakiel Norne. Why can the player simply walk through walls and solid objects?  That is not a question, or what Buddhist monks would call Mu, or nothingness. What is the point of asking, when knowledge itself has no value in SN? Life in the game world is in a state of artificial nature,  Hobbsian circumstances¡ªnasty, brutish, and short. The lack of obstacles simply aids in the metaphysics of the contradictions within this powerful work of neoliterature, creating a rich philosophical masterpiece that defies observation."
